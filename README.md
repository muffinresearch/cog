# Cog - static, living styleguide generator

Cog is a simplistic approach to generating a static, living styleguide from markdown templates and config.

Examples are rendered and written out into html files that are included in the styleguide via resizable iframes.

## Status

This project is undergoing some major refactoring presently. So there may be breaking changes.

## Example and docs

The docs of this tree are rendered with cog itself (so meta :)). Check them out here: http://cog.muffinresear.ch/

## Todos

* Split out the rendering of each file - to make file watching a bit nicer.
* Add injection of snippet into a page by selector.
* Add a jsx example.
