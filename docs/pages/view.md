# View Example

This example shows that you can point at a view template and
render that straight out of your project's tree.

This way the styleguide is a living representation of the templates
and styles in your tree.

``` iframe
renderer: nunjucks
template: example-page.html
para: This is content rendered from the iframeContext object supplied in the conf
```
