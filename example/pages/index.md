# Example styleguide

This is a quick demo of what's possible with cog.

This styleguide both provides examples with its own local templates and also
refers to a set of templates in an external directory.

The idea being that you can have both examples that you build in the styleguide
with smaller bits of code, e.g. typography and buttons and you can also
directly render existing view templates and just specify your own context.

## Markdown pages

This page content is written with markdown. So it's super easy to add whatever
documentation you need to support the styleguide examples.

Other code examples can be provided using Github flavoured Markdown (GFM).

```javascript
function test(arg) {
  console.log(arg);
}
```

## The index page

This page is the index page so it doesn't typically come with anything other than
rendered markdown.
